# Interface Segregation Principle - ISP

## Definition
- A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use

## Purpose
- This principle aboids creating large, unwieldy interfaces and promotes smaller, role-specific interfaces

## Notes
- The interface should be more closely related to the code that used it than the code that implements it.

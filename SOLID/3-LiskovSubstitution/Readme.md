# Liskov Substitution Principle - LSP

## Definition
- Objects of superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the currectness of the program

# Purpose
- This principle ensures that derived classes can stand in for their base classes without breaking the functionality,
maintaining the 'is-a' relationship

## Notes
- You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification.
